# Integration with Antares Cloud using XML and Retrofit

This guide will walk you through the process of integrating your project with the Antares Cloud using XML and Retrofit. We'll be using the following libraries for this integration:

- OkHttp: A powerful HTTP client for making network requests.
- Logging Interceptor: An OkHttp interceptor for logging HTTP requests and responses.
- Gson: A library for converting Java objects to JSON and vice versa.
- Retrofit: A type-safe HTTP client for defining API interfaces.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following dependencies included in your project's build.gradle file:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // Other dependencies...

    implementation "com.squareup.okhttp3:okhttp:4.9.3"
    implementation "com.squareup.okhttp3:logging-interceptor:4.9.1"
    implementation "com.google.code.gson:gson:2.10.1"
    implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:retrofit:2.9.0"
    implementation "com.squareup.retrofit2:converter-gson:2.9.0"
}
# Network Module for Antares Cloud Integration

In this section, we'll cover the network module required for integrating your project with the Antares Cloud using Retrofit. This module defines how to set up the network communication and authentication headers.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, make sure you have integrated the required libraries and dependencies as mentioned in the previous sections.

## Network Module Implementation

To communicate with the Antares Cloud API, we'll create a `Retrofit` instance and configure it with the necessary headers. Here's the `provideRetrofit()` function that accomplishes this:

```kotlin
import okhttp3.Interceptor
import okhttp3.OkHttpClient
import retrofit2.Retrofit
import retrofit2.converter.gson.GsonConverterFactory

fun provideRetrofit(): Retrofit {
    val client = OkHttpClient.Builder().addInterceptor(Interceptor { chain ->
        val request = chain.request().newBuilder()
            .addHeader("X-M2M-Origin", "YOUR ACCESS KEY ANTARES ACCOUNT")
            .addHeader("Content-Type", "application/json;ty=4")
            .addHeader("Accept", "application/json")
            .build()
        chain.proceed(request)
    }).build()

    return Retrofit.Builder()
        .baseUrl("https://platform.antares.id:8443/~/antares-cse/antares-id/Monitoring_System/")
        .client(client)
        .addConverterFactory(GsonConverterFactory.create())
        .build()
}
